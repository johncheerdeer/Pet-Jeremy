        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            This is the story of Jeremy. One day I had no internet. Google told me that I didn't have it. I said “aww, shucks!“ but I went to open spotlight on my Mac to open Visual Studio Code (which is a text editor for coding) I accidentally did not hold the command key, and some magnificent happens. The dinosaur started moving! I pressed the space bar to jump over the cactuses, but then, it died. I was sad for year’s until I decided to try again because I had no WiFi, then I noticed you can’t lose the game. Then I saw a video of the dinosaurs wife, so I decided for them to have a kid! I designed a kid and bam. Out of nowhere, I decided to name him Jeremy. But his parents were always working so that these humans were having fun when they had no internet. So I gave him a small place to live on the web, though he lived in a sketchy place. I am going to move his house to a nice neighborhood soon. He is not loved yet by many, but that’s where you guys come in. You should pet him every day to comfort his poor soul. And maybe one day he will see his dad.
